To create a repository on GitHub, first you do all the stuff that DevBootcamp does to your Terminal and get Sublime and everything. Then you create an account with Github. Then you hit the little plus button on the top right of your GitHub home screen, or otherwise find a repository and fork it first. Then you clone it by using "git clone" in Terminal and the URL that GitHub lists.

Open source means that the code of a project is on the web and available for others to view. It's like a public Git! I think open source is great in that helps with collaboration and it provides the best potential for innovation and dicovery.  I think the only downside to open source is the possibility that someone steals your creative work that is free and charges for it. The important of using licenses is that even the broadest licences have the need to disclose the license which I think mitigates the possibility of someone else unethically (while legally) making money off of your creative work.

What was solidified most was the whole git process which is essentially like uploading to FTP which I have done for some websites before but way better because of the way that everything is tracked. I had a few "aha" moments. First, getting the whole "checkout", "git status", "git branch", and everything worked out. I think I accidentally created a git repo clone in a git repo clone and that had me hung up for a long time because I couldn't checkout to master. After I deleted the clone using Finder (GUI feels so dirty now) it worked. Second, understanding how creating a new branch works just in terms of getting the branch uploaded to GitHub and then getting it merged, then updating the local master branch. Third, and this is my proudest one: I figured out how to get the subl command to work after it not working. The instructions on Sublime's website gave me an error. I was really proud of that one because using Google did not answer the question, and everyone is using it in the videos and it really does make it so much easier since you don't need the mouse.
