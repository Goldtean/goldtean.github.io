        <h2>Rumble In The Ruby Jungle - Arrays vs. Hashes</h2>
        <p>Ever since Ruby was created by Rubert R. Rubinsky in 1885*, code writers have been fighting about which way to gather things inside of other things. Many PCs lives have been lost. Let's end the siliconshed.</p>
        <p>Basically, an array is a list of ruby ojects. These objects can be numbers like integers or floats, or groups of letters like names or other data. When you want to pull an object from the list, you call it in this format: "rubyarray(0)". That line would basically pull the very first item in an array named rubyarray. Because Ruby isn't afraid of zeroes, 0 is the first object in an array, and 1 is the second object.</p>
        <p>Hashes are similar to arrays. They also store data, but they store it in the form of key / value combinations. Where you would call an object in an array by it's relative position inside of the array, you would call a value by it's key inside of a hash.</p>
        <p>Here's how to create an array or a hash in Ruby:</p>


        <p>array1 = ["item1", "item2", 3, 4]</p>
        <p class ="brush: ruby">my_info = {[key, value], [key, value]}</p>
        <p>An important note about hash key / value pairs is that there cannot be repeated kays in hashes, but there can be repeated values for multiple keys.</p>

        <p>Putting it all together, arrays should be used when you want to store a list of data that is significant on its own. Say, for example, you want to analyze return variations for a certain stock over a period of time. You could use an array. But say you wanted to analyze that same list of returns, but you wanted a timestamp associated with each price. Since a stock can have the same price at multiple times, but can only have one price at any given time, the timestamp should be the key and the value should be the stock's price.</p>
