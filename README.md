#### This is my personal site. I just moved from a hand coded basic HTML/CSS site to a responsive site with some JavaScript easter eggs. I will add more in the coming weeks. I will also re-add my blog and an about section, I just need to create a new template for them.

#### Eventually, I will add the ability to comment on posts and other fun(ner) stuff. There are plans! ;-) Stay tuned!
