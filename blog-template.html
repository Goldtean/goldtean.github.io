<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was interesting. We discussed each of our own approach and how and our justification for how we approached it.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, I think it makes coding easier since you have a framework and an outline for all of your elements.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided that basically a quick easy sketch and then moving on to coding is a great approach. We both thought that spending too much time on the wireframe was not helpful, as that time is better spent iterating on the website.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned quite a few - nav, header, footer, and aside come to mind.
