        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I recently left my job at a large retail bank in Canada where I helped clients with financial planning, investing, mortgages, and any other banking need. Although I enjoy helping people and finance in general, I did very little creating and did not get to exercise my creative capacity.</p>
          <p>This is why I am becoming a web developer. I am attending <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">DevBootcamp</a> in San Francisco, California from February to May 2016, where I will learn Ruby on Rails, engineering best practices, and people skills (not that, I, ahem, need any help on that last one.)</p>
          <p>Afterwards, I plan to take over the world in the following ways:</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Become A Silicon Valley Tycoon</code></summary>
            <p>I have some ideas that I would consider the low hanging fruit of the web app world. I will assemble a team of the best of the best from DevBootcamp and we will take the venture capital fund raising world by storm.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Raise Money For A Hedge Fund</code></summary>
            <p>You give me money, I give you back more money.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Get A Real Job</code></summary>
            <p>I love money and programming, you love great design and talented individuals willing to give it their all. Let's make a deal.</p>
        </details>
        <p>Other than coding and finance, I enjoy skiing, Starcraft, and the fresh feeling you get after a shower.</p>
