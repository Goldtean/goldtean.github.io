<p>The name of this blog comes from the fact that I was born in Romania and immigrated to Canada. I strongly believe in immigration and my tax dollars suggest that you should believe in it too.</p>
<p>I have worked in finance since 2007, when I graduated from St. Francis Xavier University with a Bachelor's Degree in Economics. January 2016 I embarked on a journey to learn code and went to San Francisco, California to attend DevBootcamp. I learned full stack programming by way of Ruby, JavaScript, Sinatra, and Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>Recently I have been getting into Machine Learning using Python and it's awesome libraries. After, I plan on tackling AI and building a stock trading robot to take over the world. Muahahahaha!</p>
<p>Notable coding languages and frameworks I have experience with include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>iOS development using Swift</li>
  <li>React & React Native</li>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
  <li>AJAX</li>
  <li>Git</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>TensorFlow</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the various finance courses I have finished are the following:
<ul>
  <li>CFA Level 1 Exam</li>
  <li>Canadian Securities Course</li>
  <li>Investment Funds in Canada Course</li>
  <li>Branch Compliance Officer</li>
  <li>Financial Planning I</li>
  <li>Financial Planning II</li>
  <li>Life License Qualification Program</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides scholarly pursuits, I enjoy skiing, reveling in the vanity of Instagram, and watching movies.</p>
