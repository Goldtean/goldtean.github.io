<p>The name of this blog comes from the fact that I was born in Romania and immigrated to Canada. I strongly believe in immigration and my tax dollars suggest that you should believe in it too.</p>
<p>I have worked in finance since 2007, when I graduated from St. Francis Xavier University with a Bachelor's Degree in Economics. January 2016 I embarked on a journey to learn code and went to San Francisco, California to attend DevBootcamp. I learned full stack programming by way of Ruby, JavaScript, Sinatra, and Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>Recently I have been learning machine learning using Python and it's many libraries. After, I plan on tackling AI and building a stock trading robot to make me rich beyond my wildest dreams. Muahahahaha!</p>
<p>Coding languages and frameworks I have experience with include: iOS development using Swift, React & React Native, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, Git, Python and TensorFlow.</p>
<p>Among the various finance courses I have finished are the following: CFA Level 1 Exam, Canadian Securities Course, Investment Funds in Canada Course, Financial Planning I, Financial Planning II, and the Life License Qualification Program.</p>
<p>Besides scholarly pursuits, I enjoy skiing, reveling in the vanity of Instagram, and watching movies.</p>
