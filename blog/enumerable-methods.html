        <h2>Blog Week 4</h2>
        <p>January 10th, 2016</p>
        <h2>Enumerable#Map</h2>
        <p>This week I have a very special topic to write about - the enumerable map method. If you're like me a couple of months ago, you aren't understanding those last three words. You understand map and method, but not in this context.</p>
        <p>I have some excellent news for you! I am here to explain it. Basically, it works like this:</p>
        <p>Say you have a list of numbers. It's not a bad list, you know, it's okay, but it's not great. You like it, you don't love it. You want to love it, if you could only add 1 to each number to make it a little bit better, and then have that new list of bigger and better numbers returned.</p>
        <p>That's what the map enumerable is here to do! Let's take a look.</p>
        <p>ok_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]</p>
        <p>ok_list.map {|number| number + 1}</p>
        <p>#=> [2, 3, 4, 5]</p>
        <p>Let's go step by step here. First, we are setting an array of 1, 2, 3, and 4 equal to ok_list. Then, we use .map to iterate over each element in the list to add 1. In this instance, .map will return a new array with the results.</p>
        <p>That's all for this week, y'all!</p>
