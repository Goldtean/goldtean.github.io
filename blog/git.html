        <h2>Blog Week 1</h2>
        <p>December 6, 2015</p>
        <h2>How I learned to Git, Git, Git It.</h2>
        <p>The benefits of version control are that you can track your changes and it's possible for multiple users to create branches which don't affect the master code. They can then merge branches together or merge with the master branch.</p>
        <p>Git helps you keep track of changes because it keeps a log of every commit, which is like a save-game for your work. You can then go back to it whenever you need to. You can make lots of commits, and then push them to GitHub, which stores them. You can then merge it with the master code and then delete the branches.</p>
        <p>GitHub is awesome for storing code because it's easy to use, it works with git, it has social network components, and it's easy to share and find code. It also lets you easily and instantly make a cool blog like this one!</p>
        <p>That being said, "easily" is a relative term! It's easy when you have a few YouTube videos showing you how to do it, and when your computer is set up with all the right environments.</p>
        <p>Tune in next week, same Bat Time, same Bat Channel, for another exciting edition of Jeremy's Developer Blog!</p>
