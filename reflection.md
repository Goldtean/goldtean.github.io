#Reflection 3.5 Your Website Solo Challenge#
##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?##
I learned they aren't as easy as they seemed on the other challenges! Keeping everything straight can be difficult when you're trying to put a ton of elements together that are not all sized the same.
##What did you learn about CSS positioning?##
I learned that it takes a lot of trial and error to get to where you want to go, and that even then it's not so easy. Things are by default set to static, which means that moving them will move them from their default state.
##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?##
The entire thing was difficult. I wasn't able to actually mimic my wireframe because I did not like how it looked. I still don't like how it looks, but I can live with it, and I plan on changing it over the coming Christmas break. Getting the blog links to stack was easy, and getting things to stack vertically in general is easy as that's the default. Everything else was hard.
##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?##
I learned that I need to learn a lot more! I want to improve the page and will work on making it better. Some of the interesting things I learned include using a picture as a background, and getting a border around text.
